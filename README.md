# Interactive Storytelling System for Lateral Thinking Puzzles
## [Demo Link](https://ff784baff100669b45.gradio.live)

## Abstract
This project explores AI applications in multimodal interaction and lateral thinking reasoning, aiming to develop
an AI-powered Interactive Storytelling System for Lateral
Thinking Puzzles. These puzzles require players to think
divergently and use logical deduction to uncover hidden
narratives. The system integrates computer vision (ViT +
CLIP), natural language processing (GPT-4), and speech
interaction (Speech-to-Text APIs), allowing users to engage
via text, voice, or images for a more interactive and immersive experience. By combining vision, language, and speech
models, it enhances AI adaptability in reasoning-based
games, enabling dynamic story adjustments and creative
storytelling. This project advances AIâ€™s role in creative
thinking, logical reasoning, and human-AI co-creation, offering new insights into AI-driven storytelling and interactive entertainment.
